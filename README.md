For your assignment, using Core HTML and CSS, you are to individually develop a 3 page layout for a website.
- The website may be for a Hotel, a School or a Company.
- The three pages for this layout are: Home, About and Contact.
- Each page should have a header allowing navigation to the other pages.
- Each page should have a standard footer where some dummy social media links should be placed.
- The Home page must contain (but not limited to) a Hero Section and a services section.
- Flexbox must be used in this project.
  
As discussed today, use Git to shift your existing codebase to a repository. Next create a new branch for managing the changes/updates that need to be done on the website.

Additionally, you are requested to catch up with the study materials that were shared last week, and the ones that have been updated on the Resources document (link shared last week). The intention is to have a clear and concise idea of client-server models, HTTP methods and APIs before diving into React.
